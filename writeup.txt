-Describes knowledge representation in full detail
	The first knowledge representation we used kept track of only an objective and a temporary target. The objective would be either a mineable asteroid or the home base. The temporary target is measured as a displacement from this target, and is set to a non-zero value whenever something passes between the ship and its target. This is intended to allow the ship to skirt the obstacle, and then continue pursuit of the objective.
	Specifically, all the ships, asteroids, and bases in the game are tested to see if they intersect the ship-sized swath that the ship cuts on its way to the temporary target. If they would, the temporary target is set to one side of the obstruction, with a displacement having magnitude equal to 1.2 times the combined radius of the ship and the obstruction. If the obstruction is drifting to the left or right across the ship's field of view, the target is placed on the opposite side of said obstruction, so that we won't have to move the target next tick when the obstruction drifts further.
	The temporary target is zeroed (reset to the objective, since it's a displacment) when either of two situations occur:
	A) The path straight to the objective becomes clear, in which case whatever situation created the waypoint is now irrelevant
	B) We've reached the temporary target. In this case there's a fair chance that something else is now in the way, and a new temporary target will shortly be computed.

-Heuristic used
The heuristic used tries to fly in a straight line at constant speed (the speed of a speeding bullet) towards the target. If it has minerals it goes to its home base, otherwise it chooses whichever mineable asteroid is closest to the base and has a clear line of sight to the ship. It doesn't bother to slow down before collecting asteroids, because that takes time and we visit home base often enough for energy to not be a serious concern.

-Why these were good choices
The knowledge representation and heuristic chosen combine to make a very single-minded agent, which is suitable for a first attempt at an environment where the goal is clearly defined. The heuristic alternates bases and asteroids to minimize risk of lost cargo, and doesn't both with deceleration to save time. The knowledge representation stores only the bare minimum needed to avoid unnecessary collisions, and stores the information persistently to avoid unnecessry recalculation.

-Why we chose co-op path
We chose to participate in the co-op ladder because it's a more stable environment - we know exactly who we'll be competing with, so we can know in adance when we have a sufficiently good agent.
